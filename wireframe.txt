First, you'll want to list out all of the distinct views in your application.
* is for not planned for now but good stretch goals or future work

*start screen-log in or sign up
*registration screen:user email, password, location
*new user walkthrough-sets up favorite beers/ciders/meads, favorite locations,
    one or more favorite cities
Dashboard: start a new search, review notes* or previous places tried*, 
    access settings to add new favorites or location.*
New search screen -enter in area, type of drink, with or without food
Results - filter by avg rating, distance, prices
*User settings-save notes on locations visited, specific drinks or brewers.


Next, you'll write out the "what the user sees, what the user does, what happens" statements for each page, covering all the possible paths through your app.

Start screen: User sees a welcome message, drop downs to search by beer, cider, or mead.
              submit form based on location/zip code
              radio button: with or without food
              Submit button
              user selcts from drop downs, enters zip code or city& State, and checks with or without food
              user submits through button to start search

  Results screen: user gets results sorted automatically as returned from api.
                  User has a drop down to select sort based on miles, avg ratings, price*
                  user selects a result and clicks on it to be redirected to the location website (open in new tab)            

Finally, before moving on to implement your prototype, we recommend that you also create "back-of-a-napkin" wireframes for each screen in your app.
